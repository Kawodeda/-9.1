Enter two polynomials:

Enter the max power of x: 4
coefficient of x^4 = 4
coefficient of x^3 = 2
coefficient of x^2 = 3
coefficient of x^1 = 5
coefficient of x^0 = 2

Enter the max power of x: 2
coefficient of x^2 = 2
coefficient of x^1 = 1
coefficient of x^0 = 1

The product: 8x^6 + 8x^5 + 12x^4 + 15x^3 + 12x^2 + 7x + 2
